    <h2>Deal with Certs Expiration</h2>
<p>This guide is for the case that you use <a href="http://runbooks.starkandwayne.com/vault_and_safe.html">Vault and Safe</a>
to manage your credentials for your BOSH and CF deployments.</p>
<p><code>safe x509 validate [OPTIONS] path/to/cert</code> will validate a certificate in the Vault,
checking CA signatories,expiration, name applicability, etc.</p>
<p><code>safe x509 renew [OPTIONS] path/to/certificate</code> will renew the cert specified in the
path. Option <code>-t</code> can be configured to define how long the cert will be valid for.
It defaults to the last TTL used to issue or renew the certificate.</p>
<p>A script can be written to iterate all the certs that need to be validated and renewed
based the above safe commands.</p>
<p>To take a step further, you can also use <a href="https://starkandwayne.com/blog/doomsday-an-x509-certificate-monitor/">Doomsday</a> to monitor your certs so you can take actions before your certs expire.</p>
<h2>Migrate Your CF From One vSphere Cluster to Another</h2>
<p>If you need to migrate your CF from one vSphere cluster to another, you can follow
the following major steps in two different scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>VMotion Works when VMs are Alive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check backup for CF is set successfully if you have any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off BOSH resurrection, otherwise BOSH will try to self-recover/recreate
your VMs that are down when you try to migrate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new cluster in the same vCenter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vMotion the CF VMs to the new cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete or rename the old cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the new cluster to the old cluster’s name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Bosh resurrection</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything should be working as normally after this process in the new cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Vmotion Does Not Work when VMs are Alive</strong></p>
<p>vMotion between the two clusters when VMs are running may not work due to
the CPU compatibility and other issues between the two clusters. In this case, you
have to power off VMs before you do vMotion. The steps for migration are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check backup for CF is set successfully if you have any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off BOSH resurrection, otherwise BOSH will try to self-recover/recreate
your VMs that are down when you try to migrate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new cluster in the same vCenter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>bosh stop</code> on a subgroup of the VMs so there were still same type VMs running
to keep the platform working. <code>bosh stop</code> without <code>--hard</code> flag by default will
stop VM while keeping the persistent disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power off those BOSH stopped VMs to do vMotion to the new cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After vMotion, bring the VMs in the new cluster up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the above process until you migrate all the VMs over to the new cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete or rename the old cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the new cluster to the old cluster’s name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn the BOSH resurrection back on</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything should be working as normally after this process in the new cluster.</p>
<h2>Migrate vSphere Datastore for BOSH and CF</h2>
<p>It is extremely important that you check the disks are successfully attached to
the new datastore you would like to use before you move forward with your deployments.
To migrate your BOSH and CF to a new datastore, you can follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach new datastore(s) to the hosts where the BOSH and CF VMs are running (Do not
detach the old datastores)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change deployment manifest for the BOSH Director to configure vSphere CPI to
reference new datastore(s)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>properties:
  vsphere:
    host: your_host
    user: root
    password: something_secret
    datacenters:
    - name: BOSH_DC
      vm_folder: sandbox-vms
      template_folder: sandbox-templates
      disk_path: sandbox-disks
      datastore_pattern: '\new-sandbox\z' # &lt;---
      persistent_datastore_pattern: '\new-sandbox\z' # &lt;---
      clusters: [SANDBOX]
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Redeploy the BOSH Director</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the BOSH Director VM’s root, ephemeral and persistent disks are all
now on the new datastore(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>bosh deploy --recreate</code> for CF deployments so that VMs are recreated and
persistent disks are reattached</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the persistent disks and VMs were moved to new datastore(s) and
there are no remaining disks in the old datastore(s)</p>
</li>
</ol>
